GUI deployment link : http://401cloudserver-env-1.eba-3wurmqwf.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
CLI deployment link: http://cloud-server-cli-env.eba-hkexhspw.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

## Process:
1. GUI deployment was straightforward as in the steps listed in the class notes.
2. CLI deployment was very error prone as the dependencies for eb cli were hard to install.
3. Finally, I tested using Postman.
